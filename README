This library is a very basic Eiffel interface to the FFTW library.
To download the code for FFTW go to http://www.fftw.org.

We've only implemented the basic functionality we needed.
Basically we did the real one-, two-, and three-dimensional
fourier transforms.

The following classes are part of this library:

FFTW_MATRIX
	- represents matrices that are used as input and outputs 
      of the 2D fourier transforms

FFTW_3DTENSOR
	- a tensor that is the input and output of the 3D transform

FOURIER_OPERATOR
	- an abstract specification for a fourier operator class

FFTW_1D_FOURIER_OPERATOR
	- one dimensional real transform, transforms ARRAY [DOUBLE]

FFTW_2D_FOURIER_OPERATOR
	- two dimensional real transform, transforms FFTW_MATRIX
	

FFTW_3D_FOURIER_OPERATOR
	- three dimensional real transform, transforms FFTW_3DTENSOR

The library has been tested mosly with Halstenbach compiler, but
is should be real easy to get it to work with ISE. We have
used this code on Solaris, Linux and Windows NT.

The "test" directory contains some test classes and an Ace file
for Halstenbach.
